// 140 by 140 grid again
// probably do the ole 2d array?

//   maybe matching x and then checking adjacent squares for M
//        - none, move on, 
//        - find one, continue in that direction and check for an A, 
//        - none, move on, check for S

//      a bit slow, tho 
//   maybe check for easy ones first? do a l-r pass, then a top-bottom pass? if so, probably double check xmas and samx?
